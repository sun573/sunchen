      Hello! I am a consultant specializing in the analysis, implementation, and support of supply chain planning solutions, with over three years of OMP experience. 
    </h2>

    <p>My professional experience includes internships at Porsche, Siemens, and Fedex Freight. After graduating from Georgia Tech with honors, 
      I joined OMP, an international supply chain software company, as a consultant, where I can combine my technical and interpersonal skills. 
      I worked with a diverse set of projects and clients, and I was able to use everything that I've learned in my course work as well as my 
      professional experience. After almost two years at OMP, I left and started consulting independently for companies who use OMP. I perform testing and validation, as well as analysis and implementation. 
      <br><br>Outside of work, I enjoy sports such as rock climbing, ultimate frisbee, tennis, skiing, biking, 
      bowling, hiking, and running. On the artistic side, you'll often find me behind the camera; I love photography and videography. 
      In addition to sports and cameras, I love going fast! Racecars are a large part of my life, and I enjoy building and driving
      racecars. I also instruct for many racing and high performance driving programs throughout the southeast. I also race FPV drones, 
      and I enjoy attending drone races. If you'd like to see some of my content, 
      <a href="/photos.html">
        you can check out my photo gallery</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SunnyChen">, and I often post videos on my Youtube channel.</a>
      
      <br><br>
      Below, you will find a list of the multitude of software suites I have worked with, as well as my various competencies within each. I look forward to connecting with you!
